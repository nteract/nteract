"""Typed string constants mirroring the Rust daemon enums.

These are the same literals the Rust ``runtime_doc`` crate writes to the
CRDT and the TypeScript ``@runtimed`` package exposes to the frontend.
Pulling them in as Python constants lets readers match on kernel state
without typing bare strings. A typo in ``"missing_ipykernel"`` is
caught at import time rather than producing a silent always-false
comparison.

The Rust enums (``KernelErrorReason``, ``RuntimeLifecycle``) are the
authoritative API; this module only surfaces the wire strings they
serialise to. Treat this file as a cross-language reference point: if
you're adding a new variant, add it here AND on the Rust/TS sides to keep
the three languages in lockstep.
