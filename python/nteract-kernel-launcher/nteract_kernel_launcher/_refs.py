    No URL is stored. The frontend derives the blob-server URL from the hash
    at render time (``ContentRef`` resolution in WASM), which keeps outputs
    durable across blob-server port changes. Kernel-side code that wants a
    URL for external tooling should call into the daemon explicitly (e.g.
    ``runt daemon status --json``); URLs are not part of dx's persistent
