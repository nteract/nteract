description: Work with the per-worktree runtimed daemon in the nteract desktop repo. Use when changing `crates/runtimed/**`, debugging daemon-backed notebook behavior, deriving `RUNTIMED_SOCKET_PATH`, checking daemon logs/status, running daemon-backed tests or reviews, or deciding whether to use the `nteract-dev` MCP tools (`up`/`down`/`status`/`logs`/`vite_logs`) versus manual `cargo xtask dev-daemon` commands.

# nteract Daemon Dev

Use this skill to avoid talking to the wrong daemon and to keep daemon-backed verification tied to the current worktree.

## Workflow

1. Prefer the `nteract-dev` MCP tools (`up`, `down`, `status`, `logs`, `vite_logs`) when they are available.
2. Decide whether you are validating the default nightly source flow or an explicit stable flow. Source builds are nightly unless `RUNT_BUILD_CHANNEL=stable`.
3. Otherwise, treat the worktree daemon as mandatory for daemon-backed verification.
4. Export `RUNTIMED_DEV=1` and `RUNTIMED_WORKSPACE_PATH="$(pwd)"` before any manual `runt` command.
5. Start or restart the daemon before validating changes in `crates/runtimed/**`, notebook sync paths, or Python integration flows.
6. Derive `RUNTIMED_SOCKET_PATH` from `./target/debug/runt daemon status --json` before running Python or cross-implementation tests.

## Guardrails

- Stop the daemon with `./target/debug/runt daemon stop`. System-wide killers (`pkill`, `killall`) affect every worktree on the machine.
- Assume the worktree daemon is the target for dev work; the system daemon is for diagnostics only.
- Let the human launch the notebook GUI from their own terminal.
- If a test or script depends on notebook execution, blob resolution, or MCP server behavior, confirm it is pointed at the worktree daemon first.
- Use `default_socket_path()` for the current process. Reach for `socket_path_for_channel(...)` only when you intentionally need stable/nightly discovery that ignores `RUNTIMED_SOCKET_PATH`.
- **Any daemon code that reads CRDT state, does async work, then writes back must reconcile against the pre-await heads.** Prefer `NotebookDoc::transact_at_heads_recovering(...)` for notebook-doc writes; use `fork_with_actor(...)` + `merge_recovering(...)` only when an editable fork must cross the await. For synchronous blocks, prefer typed live-doc mutations or document-owned transaction helpers; keep `doc.fork_and_merge(|fork| { ... })` for older isolated-draft call sites. See `contributing/crdt-mutation-guide.md` and `.codex/skills/nteract-notebook-sync/references/crdt-ownership.md`.

## Quick Start

If you have `nteract-dev` tools, use them for daemon lifecycle and logs.

If you do not, read [references/daemon-workflows.md](references/daemon-workflows.md) and follow the manual command sequence there.
