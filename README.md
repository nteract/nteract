# nteract/nteract

if you're here looking for the Electron-based nteract desktop app, you can view the source [in this repo](https://github.com/nteract/archived-desktop-app). **That desktop app is not actively maintained.**

## The New Desktop App

We're actively developing the spritual successor to the nteract desktop app in the [nteract/desktop repo](https://github.com/nteract/desktop).

The new app is a native desktop app with instant startup, real-time collaboration, and intelligent environment management.
