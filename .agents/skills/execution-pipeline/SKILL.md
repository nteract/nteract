# Cell Execution Pipeline

Use this skill when debugging execution-related issues: cells that
don't execute, outputs that don't appear, execution that times out,
or MCP tools that return empty results. This traces the full path
from tool invocation to resolved outputs.

## The Five Stages

### Stage 1: Causal Precondition (required_heads)

Before sending an execute request, the client captures the current
Automerge heads of the notebook document:

```rust
let required_heads = handle.current_heads_hex()?;
```

These heads are attached to the request envelope. The daemon's
`wait_for_required_heads()` defers processing until all listed change
hashes exist in its copy of the notebook document (checked via
`get_change_by_hash` — a ChangeGraph containment check).

**Why this matters:** Without `required_heads`, the daemon might
execute against stale cell source — the client wrote "x = 1" but the
daemon hasn't received that sync frame yet, so it executes the old
"x = 0".

**Timeout:** 10 seconds. If heads don't arrive, the daemon logs a
warning and processes anyway (graceful degradation).

**Frontend optimization:** Before capturing heads, the frontend calls
`flushSync()` to push any pending source edits into the sync stream,
minimizing the daemon-side wait.

### Stage 2: Request Submission

The client sends an `ExecuteCell` or batch `RunAllCells` request:

```rust
let request = NotebookRequest::ExecuteCell {
    cell_id: cell_id.to_string(),
};
let response = handle.send_request_after_heads(request, required_heads).await;
```

`send_request_after_heads` wraps the request in a
`NotebookRequestEnvelope` with the captured heads and sends it through
the sync task.

### Stage 3: Daemon Queuing

The daemon receives the request, waits for required heads (Stage 1),
reads the cell source from its synced notebook document, and queues
execution with the kernel:

1. Daemon reads source from its `NotebookDoc` (the CRDT, not the
   `.ipynb` file)
2. Creates a unique `execution_id`
3. Writes to `RuntimeStateDoc`: execution entry with status `"queued"`,
   then `"running"` when the kernel starts
4. Responds with `CellQueued { execution_id, position }` immediately
5. Forwards code to the kernel via ZMQ `execute_request`

**Key invariant:** The daemon writes `set_execution_done(eid, success)`
to RuntimeStateDoc ONLY AFTER all output manifests for that execution
are committed. This ordering guarantee is what makes RuntimeStateDoc
polling reliable.

**Control-plane invariant:** Kernel lifecycle signals (`KernelIdle`,
`ExecutionDone`, `CellError`, `KernelDied`) are not output transport.
They must not share bounded queues with stdout floods, display churn, or
Output widget replay. If output work is pending, drain lifecycle/control
signals first so interrupts and queue release remain responsive.

**Output-widget replay:** RuntimeStateDoc is the durable source of truth for
captured Output widget outputs. The kernel-facing `SendCommUpdate` replay is
best-effort output work on a bounded queue. IOPub output arms must use
non-blocking enqueue/drop semantics for replay and must not `.await` a bounded
work-channel send before they can observe later status messages.

**Display updates:** `update_display_data` messages with `display_id` are
transient display churn. Coalesce them by `display_id` and commit only the
latest pending update off the IOPub hot path. Flush pending display updates
after `KernelIdle` and before `ExecutionDone` so terminal runtime state still
means durable output state is available.

**Stream-output committer:** stdout/stderr chunks may be coalesced and
periodic flushes may be dropped when pressure is high. The terminal buffer
holds the latest rendered state. Ordering-sensitive boundaries, such as
display/error output after a stream, use the stream committer's priority path
and wait for the stream flush before clearing terminal state. `ExecutionDone`
also uses the priority path so the final stream manifest is durable before the
runtime state becomes terminal.

### Stage 4: Terminal Wait (RuntimeStateDoc Polling)

The client polls RuntimeStateDoc for execution completion:

```rust
await_execution_terminal(handle, &execution_id, timeout, None).await
```

**Phase 1 — Terminal status poll:**
- Polls every 50ms
- Checks `executions[eid].status` for `"done"` or `"error"`
- Also watches for kernel-level failure (`kernel.lifecycle == Error|Shutdown`)
- Returns `KernelFailed` if the kernel dies while execution is pending

**Phase 2 — Output-sync grace:**
- After terminal status is reached, the output list might still be
  empty on the client's replica (sync lag)
- Polls every 10ms for up to 500ms (the grace period)
- Exits as soon as outputs appear

**Why RuntimeStateDoc, not broadcasts:** The `ExecutionDone` broadcast
arrives over a separate channel and the client's Automerge replica may
not have caught up on the final stream writes. The RuntimeStateDoc is
authoritative — once status is `"done"`, outputs are guaranteed to be
in the same document.

### Stage 5: Output Resolution

Outputs are inline manifest Maps in RuntimeStateDoc, containing
`ContentRef` entries per MIME type:

```rust
let outputs = output_resolver::resolve_cell_outputs_for_llm(&output_manifests, ctx).await;
```

Resolution depends on MIME type:
- **Text MIME** (`text/*`, `application/json`, `image/svg+xml`):
  Inline string if ≤1KB, or fetch from blob store as UTF-8
- **Binary MIME** (`image/png`, `audio/*`, etc.):
  Always blob store. Frontend gets `http://` URL. Python gets raw bytes.
- **Widget output** (`application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json`):
  References comm state in RuntimeStateDoc

MCP execution paths use **preview mode** — output is truncated for
LLM consumption. Agents that need full output call
`get_cell(full_output=true)` separately.

## Execution ID Lifecycle

```
Client sends ExecuteCell
  → Daemon returns CellQueued { execution_id: "exec-abc" }
  → RuntimeStateDoc: executions["exec-abc"] = { status: "queued" }
  → Kernel starts: executions["exec-abc"].status = "running"
  → Outputs arrive: executions["exec-abc"].outputs = [manifest1, ...]
  → Kernel done: executions["exec-abc"] = { status: "done", success: true }
  → Client reads outputs from executions["exec-abc"].outputs
```

The `execution_id` is the stable reference for one execution attempt.
If the same cell is executed twice, each gets a different
`execution_id`. Agents can pass `execution_id` to `get_cell()` to
read outputs for a specific execution rather than the cell's current
outputs.

## Run-All Flow

`run_all_cells` follows the same pipeline but batched:

1. Captures `required_heads` once
2. Sends `RunAllCells` request with all cell IDs
3. Daemon returns `AllCellsQueued { cell_execution_ids }` — a map of
   `cell_id → execution_id` for every queued cell
4. Client polls each `execution_id` in parallel with a shared deadline
5. Returns per-cell results

**Timeout:** The shared deadline applies to the entire run, not per-cell.
If one cell takes 90% of the budget, remaining cells get less time.

## Common Failure Modes

### "Outputs are empty"

1. **Output-sync grace too short:** The execution finished but outputs
   haven't synced yet. The 500ms grace usually suffices, but very large
   outputs (big DataFrames, many plots) may need more time.
2. **execution_id mismatch:** Reading outputs with the wrong
   `execution_id` or reading the cell's "current" outputs after
   re-execution replaced them.
3. **Blob store unreachable:** Binary outputs reference blobs. If the
   blob HTTP server is down, resolution fails silently.

### "Cell didn't execute"

1. **required_heads timeout:** Daemon waited 10s for heads that never
   arrived. Check if the sync stream is healthy.
2. **Kernel not ready:** The kernel isn't started or is in error state.
   The daemon returns an error response, not `CellQueued`.
3. **Trust gate:** Untrusted notebooks may block execution pending
   approval.

### "Execution timed out"

1. **Long-running cell:** The cell genuinely takes longer than the
   timeout (default varies by caller — MCP uses 120s).
2. **Kernel hung:** The kernel process is alive but not responding.
   Check `kernel.lifecycle` in RuntimeStateDoc.
3. **Sync stall:** Terminal status was written by the daemon but the
   client's sync stream stopped delivering frames. Check daemon logs
   for sync errors.

### "Stale outputs from previous execution"

The execution completed but the outputs visible belong to an earlier
run. This happens when:
1. Reading cell outputs without using the `execution_id` — the cell's
   "current" pointer may not have been updated yet
2. The RuntimeStateDoc sync hasn't delivered the latest writes

Fix: Always use `execution_id` from the `CellQueued` response to
read outputs for a specific execution.

## Two Document Architecture

Execution spans both Automerge documents in a notebook room:

| Document | What it holds for execution |
|----------|---------------------------|
| **NotebookDoc** | Cell source code (what to execute) |
| **RuntimeStateDoc** | Execution lifecycle, outputs, kernel status |

The `required_heads` gate ensures NotebookDoc is synced before
execution starts. RuntimeStateDoc polling ensures outputs are
available before the client reads them. Both sync streams run
concurrently on the same socket connection.
