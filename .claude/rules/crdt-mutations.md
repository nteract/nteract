# CRDT Mutation Guide

## Core Principle

**The Automerge CRDT is the source of truth. The cell store is a read-only projection.**

All persistent notebook state lives in the Automerge document. The React cell store (`notebook-cells.ts`) is a materialized view that components subscribe to. It must never diverge from the CRDT -- if it does, that is a bug.

## Who Writes What

| Data | Written by | Frontend role |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Cell source text | **Frontend** (user typing via CodeMirror bridge) | Author -- `splice_source` into WASM handle |
| Cell structure (add/delete/move) | **Frontend** (user action via `commitMutation`) | Author -- `add_cell`, `delete_cell`, `move_cell` on WASM handle |
| Cell metadata (tags, visibility) | **Frontend** (user action) | Author -- `set_cell_source_hidden`, `set_cell_tags`, etc. |
| Notebook metadata (dependencies, runtime) | **Frontend** or **MCP agent** | Author -- `add_uv_dependency`, `set_metadata`, etc. |
| Execution count | **Daemon** (kernel reports it) | Read-only -- apply from daemon broadcast |
| Cell outputs | **Daemon** (kernel produces them) | Read-only -- materialize from CRDT sync |
| Output clearing (pre-execute) | **Frontend** initiates, **daemon** also writes | Author for local clear, read-only for daemon broadcast |
| Kernel status | **Daemon** | Read-only -- UI state, not in CRDT |
| Queue state (executing, queued) | **Daemon** | Read-only -- UI state, not in CRDT |

## The Two Paths

### Local mutations (user-initiated)

User does something in the UI -> write to WASM CRDT handle -> sync to daemon -> materialization updates the store.

```
User action -> WASM handle mutation -> scheduleFlush() (debounced) -> daemon
                                     -> store update (instant feedback)
```

Examples:
- Typing in a cell (`splice_source`)
- Clearing outputs before execution (`handle.clear_outputs`)
- Adding/deleting/moving cells (`commitMutation`)
- Changing cell visibility (`set_cell_source_hidden`)

The store write for instant feedback is safe because the CRDT and store agree -- materialization will write the same value when it catches up.

### Daemon projections (daemon-initiated)

Daemon writes to its CRDT -> sync frame arrives -> WASM `receive_frame` -> materialization reads from WASM -> store updated.

```
Daemon CRDT write -> sync frame -> WASM receive_frame -> materializeFromBatch -> store
                                                       -> text attributions -> CM bridge
```

The daemon also sends **broadcasts** for real-time events (kernel status, execution started, queue changes). Some trigger store-only updates for instant UI feedback:

```
Daemon broadcast -> useDaemonKernel callback -> store-only update
```

**Never write to the CRDT in response to a daemon broadcast.** The daemon already wrote to the CRDT. Writing again re-authors the same change under the frontend's actor, creates redundant sync traffic, and incorrectly marks the notebook as dirty.

## Naming Convention

| Name pattern | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `*Local` | User-initiated. Writes to CRDT + store + triggers sync. |
| `*FromDaemon` | Daemon-initiated. Store-only projection. No CRDT write, no sync, no dirty flag. |
| `apply*FromDaemon` | Same as above -- applies daemon state to the store. |

Examples:
- `applyExecutionCountFromDaemon(cellId, count)` -- daemon broadcast, store only

## The CodeMirror CRDT Bridge

Source text has its own dedicated path that bypasses both the store and the old `updateCellSource` function:

```
Outbound (typing):
  CM transaction -> ViewPlugin.update() -> iterChanges ->
  handle.splice_source(cellId, index, deleteCount, text) -> onSourceChanged -> store

Inbound (remote sync):
  receive_frame -> text attributions -> subscribeBroadcast ->
  bridge.applyRemoteChanges() -> CM dispatch (externalChangeAnnotation)
```

The bridge uses `externalChangeAnnotation` to prevent echo: inbound changes are annotated so the outbound path skips them.

## What NOT to Do

1. **Do not write to the store without writing to the CRDT first.** The store is a projection. The next materialization will overwrite your change if the CRDT disagrees.

2. **Do not write to the CRDT in a daemon broadcast callback.** The daemon already wrote. You would re-author the change, mark dirty, and generate redundant sync.

3. **Do not use `updateCellById` for persistent state changes.** Use it only for instant visual feedback *after* a CRDT write, or in `*FromDaemon` store projections.

4. **Do not bypass the bridge for source text.** The CodeMirror bridge handles character-level sync. Using `update_source` (Myers diff) from the UI would conflict with the bridge's splice tracking.

5. **Do not mutate the doc directly after an async gap.** If you read doc state, await something, then write back, prefer `NotebookDoc::transact_at_heads_recovering(...)` with heads captured before the await. Use `fork_with_actor(...)` + `merge_recovering(...)` only when a forked document must cross the async gap. For synchronous blocks, use `doc.fork_and_merge(|fork| { ... })`. See `contributing/crdt-mutation-guide.md` for the full pattern.

6. **Do not `put_object()` at a key that another peer also creates.** Two independent `put_object(ROOT, "cells", Map)` from different actors create two distinct Map objects -- an Automerge conflict. One wins; the loser's children become invisible. Document structure must be created by exactly one peer (the daemon). Other peers receive it via sync. This is why `bootstrap()` only seeds `schema_version`, not the full skeleton.
