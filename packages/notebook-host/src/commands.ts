/**
 * `CommandRegistry` — the contract between the app and whatever UI surfaces
 * fire user intents (menus, keyboard shortcuts, a future command palette, MCP).
 *
 * The app side registers handlers by name. The host side routes its native
 * UI (Tauri menu events, Electron menu clicks, web keyboard bindings) into
 * `commands.run(id, payload)`. Menu integration becomes host code and stops
 * leaking through the app.
 *
 * Why a typed command map instead of loose strings: every caller gets
 * compile-time assurance that the command exists and the payload matches.
 * Renaming a command updates every binding in one go; misspelling one
 * surfaces immediately.
 */

/**
 * Every command the app handles, keyed to its payload type.
 *
 * Add a new command here and TypeScript will require the registrar to
 * supply a handler and every caller to pass the right payload. Removing
 * one will require the same sweep in reverse.
 *
 * Keep the namespace prefix (`notebook.*`, `view.*`, `updater.*`, …)
 * stable — it doubles as a search index and mirrors how VSCode and
 * JupyterLab name their internal actions.
