/**
 * Host-platform abstraction for the notebook frontend.
 *
 * `NotebookHost` is the single surface the notebook UI uses for every
 * side-effecting call that depends on where it's running — reading the
 * daemon connection, opening files, showing dialogs, listening for
 * window events, etc. In the Tauri desktop app the implementation
 * routes through `@tauri-apps/api` + plugins; in the (coming) Electron
 * host it routes through `window.electronHost` exposed by the preload
 * contextBridge; in the future a WASM-only / browser-served host could
 * implement a subset of this API and no-op the rest.
 *
 * The notebook frontend itself should never import `@tauri-apps/*`
 * directly. Every call site goes through `useNotebookHost()` or a
 * non-React helper that takes a host instance. That constraint is what
 * lets us re-host the frontend cleanly.
 *
 * ## Design notes
 *
 * - Methods return promises even when the underlying implementation is
 *   synchronous, because some hosts (notably Electron's renderer
 *   talking to main) are async and we want one signature everywhere.
 * - Event methods take a callback and return an `unlisten` function.
 *   This matches Tauri's `webview.listen()` shape.
 * - For PR 1 / PR 2 / PR 3 the interface commits to "Tauri and Electron
 *   both implement every namespace end-to-end." If a future browser or
 *   viewer host needs partial implementations, we'll introduce explicit
 *   capability flags or mark individual namespaces optional at that
 *   point — not pre-optional now, to keep the contract honest.
