/**
 * Typed broadcast interfaces for daemon events.
 *
 * Transport-agnostic versions of the broadcast payloads sent by the daemon
 * via frame type 0x03 (BROADCAST). Provides type guards for filtering
 * the untyped `broadcasts$` observable into typed sub-streams.
 *
 * Path changes, autosave timestamps, and env-preparation progress used to be
 * broadcasts; they are now fields on `RuntimeStateDoc` (`path`, `last_saved`,
 * `env.progress`) and reach clients via normal CRDT sync. Read them via
 * `useRuntimeState()` instead of subscribing to broadcasts.
