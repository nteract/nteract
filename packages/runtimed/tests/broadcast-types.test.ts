/**
 * Tests for broadcast type guards.
 *
 * These guards narrow the untyped `broadcasts$` observable into typed
 * sub-streams. A bug here silently drops events (guard returns false
 * when it shouldn't) or lets the wrong type through (guard returns
 * true for a mismatched event). Both failure modes are quiet — no
 * runtime error, just missing kernel output or a TypeScript cast
 * that turns into NaN / undefined deep in a render.
