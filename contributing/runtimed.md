# Runtime Daemon (runtimed)

The runtime daemon manages prewarmed Python environments, notebook document sync, kernel execution, autosave, and widget state across notebook windows.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Install nightly from source (Linux/headless) | `./scripts/install-nightly` |
| Run daemon | `cargo run -p runtimed` |
| Run with debug logs | `RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -p runtimed` |
| Check status | `cargo run -p runt -- daemon status` |
| Ping daemon | `cargo run -p runt -- daemon ping` |
| View logs | `cargo run -p runt -- daemon logs -f` |
| Run tests | `cargo test -p runtimed` |

## Why It Exists

Each notebook window is a separate OS process (Tauri spawns via `spawn_new_notebook()` in `crates/notebook/src/lib.rs`). Without coordination:

1. **Race conditions**: Multiple windows try to claim the same prewarmed environment
2. **Wasted resources**: Each window creates its own pool of environments
3. **Slow cold starts**: First notebook waits for environment creation

The daemon provides a single coordinating entity that prewarms environments in the background and hands them out to windows on request.

### Kernel Execution via Runtime Agent Subprocess

Every kernel runs in a separate `runtimed runtime-agent` subprocess. The daemon coordinator resolves environments and spawns the runtime agent; the runtime agent connects back to the daemon socket as a regular Automerge peer.

```
Coordinator                    RuntimeStateDoc              Runtime Agent Peer
───────────                    ───────────────              ──────────────────
ExecuteCell request arrives
  ↓
writes execution entry     →   executions/{eid}:          → watches queue
  (source, seq, status=queued)   status: "queued"            sorts by seq
                                 source: "x = 42"            executes
                                 seq: 7
                                                           ← writes outputs
                               executions/{eid}:
                                 status: "done"
                                 outputs:
                                   oid1: { seq: 0, manifest: {...} }
                                   oid2: { seq: 1, manifest: {...} }
```

Execution is CRDT-driven — the coordinator writes execution entries (with source + sequence number) to RuntimeStateDoc. The runtime agent discovers new entries via Automerge sync and processes them in order. RPC (`RuntimeAgentRequest`/`RuntimeAgentResponse`) is only used for lifecycle operations: `LaunchKernel`, `InterruptExecution`, `ShutdownKernel`, `Complete`, `GetHistory`, `SendComm`.

**Key components:**

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Unix socket | IPC endpoint | `~/Library/Caches/<cache_namespace>/runtimed.sock` (macOS) / `~/.cache/<cache_namespace>/runtimed.sock` (Linux) |
| Lock file | Singleton guarantee | `~/Library/Caches/<cache_namespace>/daemon.lock` (macOS) / `~/.cache/<cache_namespace>/daemon.lock` (Linux) |
| Info file (legacy) | Pre-socket discovery fallback | `~/Library/Caches/<cache_namespace>/daemon.json` (macOS) / `~/.cache/<cache_namespace>/daemon.json` (Linux) |
| Environments | Prewarmed venvs | `~/Library/Caches/<cache_namespace>/envs/` (macOS) / `~/.cache/<cache_namespace>/envs/` (Linux) |
| Blob store | Content-addressed outputs | `~/Library/Caches/<cache_namespace>/blobs/` (macOS) / `~/.cache/<cache_namespace>/blobs/` (Linux) |
| Notebook docs | Persisted Automerge docs | `~/Library/Caches/<cache_namespace>/notebook-docs/` (macOS) / `~/.cache/<cache_namespace>/notebook-docs/` (Linux) |
| Snapshots | Pre-delete safety copies | `~/Library/Caches/<cache_namespace>/notebook-docs/snapshots/` (macOS) / `~/.cache/<cache_namespace>/notebook-docs/snapshots/` (Linux) |

`<cache_namespace>` is `runt` for stable builds and `runt-nightly` for nightly builds. Source builds default to nightly unless `RUNT_BUILD_CHANNEL=stable`.

**Daemon discovery is socket-first.** Clients connect to the socket and send a `GetDaemonInfo` request; the daemon answers from live state. The on-disk `daemon.json` exists only as a fallback for older daemons that don't recognise the request — it will be removed once every daemon in the wild speaks `GetDaemonInfo`. New code should not depend on `daemon.json`. See `crates/runtimed-client/src/singleton.rs::query_daemon_info`.

## Security Model

`runtimed` is a per-user daemon. The operating system account is the security
boundary: cross-user access must be denied, and same-UID access is trusted by
design.

On Unix, the daemon listens on a Unix socket inside the channel cache namespace
and sets the socket mode to `0600`. The channel-owned socket directory is kept
owner-private (`0700`) where the daemon owns that namespace; custom
`RUNTIMED_SOCKET_PATH` parents inherit the caller's filesystem policy. Any
same-UID process that can connect to the socket can intentionally use the
daemon's trusted APIs, including pool/admin requests, settings sync, notebook
sync, open/create notebook, blob storage, runtime-agent attachment, MCP, and CLI
workflows. `RUNTIMED_SOCKET_PATH` is therefore a capability-bearing pointer:
only set or pass it to processes that should be allowed to control that user's
daemon. On Windows, runtimed uses named pipes and relies on the platform's
default pipe ACLs; the `0600` socket and `0700` directory guarantees are
Unix-only.

The blob HTTP server is part of the same local trust model. It binds to
`127.0.0.1`, is read-only, and serves content-addressed blobs by unguessable
hash plus embedded renderer plugin assets. Treat blob URLs as local same-user
data exposure, not as a cross-user or remote network interface.

Linux package managers do not own the daemon lifecycle. DEB/RPM/APT packages are
not currently supported because maintainer scripts should not manage per-user
daemon instances, sockets, notebooks, or kernel processes. Linux desktop releases
use AppImage as the supported install/update artifact until a distro-native
daemon lifecycle is designed separately.

## Development Workflow

### Default: Let the notebook start it

The notebook app automatically connects to or starts the daemon on launch. The daemon is required — all kernels run as runtime agent subprocesses connected to the daemon via Unix socket.

The notebook app calls `ensure_daemon_via_sidecar()` (a private function in `crates/notebook/src/lib.rs`) which takes a `tauri::AppHandle` and a progress callback to start and connect to the daemon.

### Install the nightly stack from source (Linux / headless)

On Linux cloud boxes and headless dev environments:

```bash
./scripts/install-nightly
```

This builds `runtimed`, `runt`, and `nteract-mcp` in release mode and installs all three into `~/.local/share/runt-nightly/bin/` with channel-suffixed names (`runtimed-nightly`, `runt-nightly`, `nteract-mcp-nightly`). On first run it writes the systemd user unit and starts it; on subsequent runs it upgrades in place. After the initial install the command prints the follow-up `sudo ln -sf` symlink commands for `/usr/local/bin/` and the `sudo loginctl enable-linger` step that keeps the user service alive across logout.

It refuses by default on macOS (the desktop app manages its own daemon via SMAppService — reinstalling from source out of the app bundle is a footgun) and when an nteract app bundle is already installed on any platform. Override respectively with `--on-macos` and `--replace-installed-app` if you really mean it.

Verify the running version with:

```bash
cargo run -p runt -- daemon status --json | jq -r '.daemon_info.version'
```

For per-worktree daemon development (no system install involved), use `cargo xtask dev-daemon` instead — it runs the daemon out of the worktree with per-worktree socket isolation and no service files.

### Fast iteration: Daemon + bundled notebook

When iterating on daemon code, you often want to test changes in the notebook app without rebuilding the frontend.

**With nteract-dev** (if you have `up` / `down` / `status` MCP tools — e.g. in Zed or Claude Code):

`nteract-dev` manages the dev daemon for you. No env vars or extra terminals needed.

- `up` — idempotent "bring the dev environment up". Ensures the daemon is running and the MCP child is healthy. Pass `vite=true` to also start Vite (health-probed), `rebuild=true` to rebuild the daemon binary + Python bindings first, `mode="debug"|"release"` to switch build mode.
- `down` — stop the managed Vite dev server. Pass `daemon=true` to also stop the daemon.
- `status` — read-only report (child, daemon, managed processes, build mode).
- `logs` — tail the daemon log file.
- `vite_logs` — tail the Vite dev server log file.

Then build and run the app normally:
```bash
cargo xtask build                 # Full build (includes frontend)
cargo xtask build --rust-only     # Fast rebuild (reuses frontend assets)
cargo xtask run                   # Run the bundled binary
```

**Without nteract-dev** (manual two-terminal workflow):

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run dev daemon (restart when you change daemon code)
cargo xtask dev-daemon

# Terminal 2: Build once, then iterate
cargo xtask build                 # Full build (includes frontend)
cargo xtask build --rust-only     # Fast rebuild (reuses frontend assets)
cargo xtask run                   # Run the bundled binary
```

The `--rust-only` flag skips `pnpm build`, reusing the existing frontend assets in `apps/notebook/dist/`. This is much faster when you're only changing Rust code.

### Stable vs nightly from source

Source-built binaries default to the nightly channel. That affects daemon cache/socket namespaces, CLI/app naming, and default app launch behavior. Only set `RUNT_BUILD_CHANNEL=stable` when you are intentionally validating the stable flow:

```bash
RUNT_BUILD_CHANNEL=stable cargo xtask dev-daemon
RUNT_BUILD_CHANNEL=stable cargo xtask build --rust-only
RUNT_BUILD_CHANNEL=stable cargo xtask run
RUNT_BUILD_CHANNEL=stable cargo xtask run-mcp
```

### Testing

```bash
# All tests (unit + integration)
cargo test -p runtimed

# Just integration tests
cargo test -p runtimed --test integration

# Specific test
cargo test -p runtimed test_daemon_ping_pong
```

Integration tests use temp directories for socket and lock files to avoid conflicts with a running daemon.

## Notebook Room Lifecycle

Each open notebook has a **room** (`NotebookRoom` in `notebook_sync_server/room.rs`), keyed by UUID in `NotebookRooms`. A secondary `PathIndex` maps canonical `.ipynb` paths to room UUIDs for path-based lookups.

### Autosave

The daemon autosaves `.ipynb` on a debounce (2s quiet period, 10s max interval) via `spawn_autosave_debouncer`. No user action required. Frontend dirty state is cleared from save state/confirmations, not a room broadcast. Explicit Cmd+S additionally runs cell formatting (ruff/deno fmt).

Autosave skips untitled notebooks (no file path) and notebooks mid-load (`is_loading` flag). After saving, the debouncer drains the change channel to detect mutations during the async write so clients only observe a caught-up save state.

### Saving an untitled notebook

Room keys are always UUIDs — they never change after a room is created. When an untitled notebook is first saved:

1. Canonicalizes the save path
2. Checks `path_index` for conflicts (returns `SaveError::PathAlreadyOpen` if another room owns the path)
3. Inserts into `path_index: HashMap<PathBuf, Uuid>` (secondary map for path → UUID lookups)
4. Updates the room's `path: RwLock<Option<PathBuf>>`
5. Spawns a file watcher for the new path
6. Updates room path state so peers can update local path tracking

The `NotebookSaved` response returns the room's UUID (unchanged).

### Crash recovery

Untitled notebooks persist their Automerge doc to `notebook-docs/{hash}.automerge`. Before deleting a persisted doc on reopen (saved notebooks reload from `.ipynb`), the daemon snapshots it to `notebook-docs/snapshots/` (max 5 per notebook hash).

Snapshots hold source and structural metadata only. Outputs live in the RuntimeStateDoc and are not persisted to disk for ephemeral notebooks.

### Multi-window

Multiple windows join the same room as separate Automerge peers. The first window gets a deterministic label (for geometry persistence); additional windows get a UUID suffix. All peers receive sync frames and broadcasts independently.

### Eviction

When all peers disconnect, a delayed eviction task runs (configurable via `keep_alive_secs` setting, default 30s). If no peers reconnect, the kernel shuts down, the file watcher stops, and the room is removed. If peers reconnect during the window, eviction is cancelled.

## Per-Cell Accessors

`NotebookDoc` and `DocHandle` expose O(1) cell reads that avoid full-document materialization:

| Method | Returns | Used by |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `get_cell_source(id)` | `Option<String>` | Daemon (execution), Python SDK, WASM |
| `get_cell_type(id)` | `Option<String>` | MCP tools, WASM |
| `get_cell_outputs(id)` | `Option<Vec<String>>` | Python SDK output collection |
| `get_cell_execution_count(id)` | `Option<String>` | WASM materialization |
| `get_cell_metadata(id)` | `Option<Value>` | Python SDK, WASM |
| `get_cell_position(id)` | `Option<String>` | WASM, fractional index operations |
| `get_cell_ids()` | `Vec<String>` (position-sorted) | Daemon, Python SDK, WASM |

These are critical for performance — `get_cells()` materializes every cell's source, outputs, and metadata. Use per-cell accessors when you only need one cell or one field.

## Protocol

See [protocol.md](./protocol.md) for the full wire protocol specification covering:

- Connection handshake and lifecycle
- Frame format (length-prefixed, typed frames)
- Automerge sync messages
- Request/response protocol
- Broadcast messages

## CLI Commands (for testing)

The `runt` CLI has daemon subcommands for testing and service management:

```bash
# Service management
cargo run -p runt -- daemon status        # Show service + pool statistics
cargo run -p runt -- daemon status --json # JSON output
cargo run -p runt -- daemon start         # Start the daemon service
cargo run -p runt -- daemon stop          # Stop the daemon service
cargo run -p runt -- daemon restart       # Restart the daemon service
cargo run -p runt -- daemon logs -f       # Tail daemon logs
cargo run -p runt -- daemon flush         # Flush pool and rebuild environments

# Debug/health checks
cargo run -p runt -- daemon ping          # Check daemon is responding
cargo run -p runt -- daemon shutdown      # Shutdown daemon via IPC
```

**Note:** In Conductor workspaces, use `./target/debug/runt` instead of `cargo run -p runt --` for faster iteration. The debug binary connects to the worktree daemon automatically.

```bash
# Kernel and notebook inspection
cargo run -p runt -- ps                   # List all kernels (connection-file + daemon)
cargo run -p runt -- notebooks            # List open notebooks with kernel info
```

## Python Bindings (runtimed-py)

The `runtimed-py` crate provides Python bindings for interacting with the daemon programmatically. This is used by the [nteract MCP server](../python/nteract/) and can be used for testing.

### Related: `dx` (kernel-side display library)

`python/dx/` is a separate Python package that kernels import to push bytes directly to the blob store via a `nteract.dx.blob` Jupyter comm, bypassing IOPub for binary payloads. Unlike `runtimed-py` (which is a client talking to the daemon), `dx` runs inside the kernel process and talks to the runtime agent over the existing kernel↔runtime-agent ZMQ. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-13-nteract-dx-design.md` for the protocol.

### Installation

There are **two Python virtual environments** in the repo:

| Venv | Path (from repo root) | Purpose |
|------|-----------------------|---------|
| Workspace venv | `.venv` | Used by the MCP server and day-to-day development |
| Test venv | `python/runtimed/.venv` | Isolated env for `pytest` runs |

Install into the **workspace venv** (MCP server, general use):

```bash
cd crates/runtimed-py
VIRTUAL_ENV=../../.venv maturin develop
```

Install into the **test venv** (pytest):

```bash
cd crates/runtimed-py
VIRTUAL_ENV=../../python/runtimed/.venv maturin develop
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
import runtimed

async def main():
    client = runtimed.Client()
    async with await client.create_notebook() as notebook:
        # Work with cells
        cell = await notebook.cells.create("print('hello')")
        result = await cell.run()
        print(result.stdout)  # "hello\n"

        cell = await notebook.cells.create("x = 42")
        await cell.run()

        # Sync reads from local CRDT
        print(cell.source)      # "x = 42"
        print(cell.cell_type)   # "code"
        print(cell.outputs)     # resolved outputs

asyncio.run(main())
```

See [docs/python-bindings.md](../docs/python-bindings.md) for the full API reference.

### Socket helper choice

Use `default_socket_path()` when you want the current process to honor `RUNTIMED_SOCKET_PATH` and otherwise follow its build channel. Use `socket_path_for_channel("stable"|"nightly")` only for explicit channel targeting or cross-channel discovery; it intentionally ignores `RUNTIMED_SOCKET_PATH`.

### Output.data Typing

`Output.data` is a `dict[str, str | bytes | dict]`. The value type depends on the MIME type:

| MIME category | Example | Python type | Notes |
|---------------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Binary image | `image/png`, `image/jpeg` | `bytes` | Raw binary data (not base64-encoded) |
| JSON | `application/json` | `dict` | Parsed JSON object |
| Text | `text/plain`, `text/html` | `str` | UTF-8 string |
| LLM hint | `text/llm+plain` | `str` | Synthesized blob URL (see below) |

### `text/llm+plain` Synthesis

When an output contains a binary image MIME (e.g. `image/png`), the daemon automatically synthesizes a `text/llm+plain` entry in `Output.data`. Its value is a multi-line description that combines any existing `text/plain`, image metadata (MIME type and size), and the blob URL. This lets LLM-based consumers reference the image without decoding binary data:

```python
result = session.run("display(Image(filename='chart.png'))")
output = result.outputs[0]

output.data["image/png"]        # b'\x89PNG\r\n...'  (raw bytes)
output.data["text/llm+plain"]   # '<IPython.core.display.Image object>\n📊 Image output (image/png, 42 KB)\nhttp://localhost:<port>/blob/<hash>'
output.data["text/plain"]       # '<IPython.core.display.Image object>'
```

### Socket Path Configuration

The Python bindings respect the `RUNTIMED_SOCKET_PATH` environment variable. This is important when testing with worktree daemons in Conductor workspaces.

**System daemon (default):**
```python
# Connects using default_socket_path(), which follows the current build
# channel unless RUNTIMED_SOCKET_PATH is already set.
client = runtimed.Client()
```

**Worktree daemon (for development):**
```bash
# Find and export your current worktree daemon socket
export RUNTIMED_SOCKET_PATH="$(
  RUNTIMED_DEV=1 RUNTIMED_WORKSPACE_PATH="$(pwd)" \
  ./target/debug/runt daemon status --json \
  | jq -r '.socket_path'
)"
python your_script.py
```

**In Conductor workspaces**, the daemon socket path varies by worktree. To test against a specific worktree daemon:

```bash
# Start the dev daemon (Terminal 1)
cargo xtask dev-daemon

# Find and export the socket path (Terminal 2)
export RUNTIMED_SOCKET_PATH="$(
  RUNTIMED_DEV=1 RUNTIMED_WORKSPACE_PATH="$(pwd)" \
  ./target/debug/runt daemon status --json \
  | jq -r '.socket_path'
)"

# Now Python bindings will use the worktree daemon
python -c "import asyncio, runtimed; asyncio.run(runtimed.Client().ping())"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Daemon won't start (lock held)

```bash
# Check what's holding the lock
lsof ~/.cache/<cache_namespace>/daemon.lock
./target/debug/runt daemon status --json   # asks the running daemon directly

# If stale (crashed daemon), remove manually
rm ~/.cache/<cache_namespace>/daemon.lock ~/.cache/<cache_namespace>/daemon.json
```

### Pool not replenishing

Check that uv/conda are installed and working:

```bash
uv --version
ls -la ~/.cache/<cache_namespace>/envs/
```

### Python bindings: "Failed to parse output" errors

If `session.run()` returns outputs like `Output(stream, stderr: "Failed to parse output: <hash>")`, the bindings are connecting to the wrong daemon (one without access to the blob store).

**Cause:** The blob store is per-daemon. When running from a Conductor workspace, you might be connecting to the system daemon while the blobs are stored in a worktree daemon's directory.

**Fix:** Set `RUNTIMED_SOCKET_PATH` to the correct daemon socket:

```bash
# Find your worktree daemon
./target/debug/runt dev worktrees

# Export the matching socket path
export RUNTIMED_SOCKET_PATH="$(
  RUNTIMED_DEV=1 RUNTIMED_WORKSPACE_PATH="$(pwd)" \
  ./target/debug/runt daemon status --json \
  | jq -r '.socket_path'

### Python bindings: get_cell() returns empty outputs

If `session.run()` shows outputs but `session.get_cell()` returns `outputs=[]`:

1. **Check socket path** (see above) — the daemon needs access to the blob store
2. **Timing issue** — outputs may not be written to Automerge yet. Try a small delay or re-fetch.

## Shipped App Behavior

When shipped as a release build, the daemon installs as a system service that starts at login. The cross-platform install/uninstall helpers live in `crates/runtimed-client/src/service.rs` and are used by the CLI/app flows:

- **macOS**: launchd plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
- **Linux**: systemd user service in `~/.config/systemd/user/`
- **Windows**: Startup folder script

### Managing the System Daemon

These commands manage the **system daemon** (production). For development, use `cargo xtask dev-daemon` instead — it provides per-worktree isolation and doesn't interfere with the system daemon.

Examples below use the stable channel names. Nightly builds use the `-nightly` variants such as `runt-nightly`, `runtimed-nightly`, and `io.nteract.runtimed.nightly`.

**Cross-platform:**
```bash
# Check status
runt daemon status

# Stop/start the system daemon
runt daemon stop
runt daemon start

# View logs
runt daemon logs -f

# Full uninstall (removes binary and service config)
runt daemon uninstall
```

**Platform-specific (if runt isn't available):**

macOS:
```bash
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/io.nteract.runtimed
launchctl list | grep io.nteract.runtimed
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.nteract.runtimed.plist
```

Linux:
```bash
systemctl --user stop runtimed.service
systemctl --user status runtimed.service
systemctl --user start runtimed.service
```

**Key paths (macOS):**
| File | Path |
|------|------|
| Installed binary | `~/Library/Application Support/<cache_namespace>/bin/<daemon_binary_basename>` |
| Service config | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/<daemon_launchd_label>.plist` |
| Socket | `~/Library/Caches/<cache_namespace>/runtimed.sock` |
| Daemon info (legacy fallback) | `~/Library/Caches/<cache_namespace>/daemon.json` |
| Logs | `~/Library/Caches/<cache_namespace>/runtimed.log` |

For stable, these expand to `runt`, `runtimed`, and `io.nteract.runtimed`. For nightly, they expand to `runt-nightly`, `runtimed-nightly`, and `io.nteract.runtimed.nightly`.
