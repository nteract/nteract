# Per-session SessionStart hook for Claude Code on the web.
#
# Wired in via .claude/settings.json. Runs every time Claude starts in a
# cloud session. Idempotent and fast on warm caches; first run after a snapshot
# rebuild does the full work.
#
# Scope: prepare the workspace for tier-(i) read and tier-(ii) build. The
# wasm + renderer-plugin artifacts that runtimed embeds via include_bytes!
# are gitignored, so a fresh clone has no copy. Bootstrap builds them via
# `cargo xtask wasm` so subsequent `cargo build` / `cargo check` calls
# don't blow up in runtimed's build.rs.
#
# Always exits 0 so a bootstrap failure never blocks the session. The agent
# can still read the log and recover. Full transcript at /tmp/cloud-bootstrap.log.
