//! Long-lived daemon session that treats metadata as a connection property.
//!
//! Rationale: `DaemonInfo` (blob_port, version, pid, started_at, worktree
//! info) is a property of the current daemon connection session. It's
//! learned on connect, stable for the life of the connection, and only
//! changes on reconnect. Treating it that way — instead of one-shot-pulling
//! it per lookup — is both cheaper and more correct: a live socket is
//! ground truth that the cached info is still valid.
//!
//! This supersedes per-lookup [`query_daemon_info`](crate::singleton::query_daemon_info)
//! for long-running consumers (Tauri app, nteract-mcp, runt-mcp-proxy). One-
//! shot CLI callers (e.g. `runt daemon status`) continue to use the
//! existing helper.
//!
//! Design doc: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-daemon-connection-session-design.md`
