//! KernelConnection trait — internal IO boundary for the runtime agent.
//!
//! This trait separates ZeroMQ IO concerns (sending execute requests, reading
//! completions, signalling interrupts) from queue/state management in the
//! runtime agent's select loop. It is NOT a plugin interface — the only
//! implementation is `JupyterKernel` in `jupyter_kernel.rs`.
//!
//! By programming the runtime agent against this trait, we can:
//! - Own the kernel directly
//! - Test queue logic with a mock kernel
//! - Clearly delineate what crosses the ZeroMQ boundary
